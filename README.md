2. Open Maze (no maze)
3. Randomized Prim's Algorithm
4. Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm (hope to implement)
5. Wilson's Algorithm (hope to implement)
6. Aldous-Broder Algorithm (hope to implement)
7. Recursive Division (hope to implement)


Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Depth first search
2. Breadth first search
3. Dijkstra's Algorithm (hope to implement)
4. A* Search (hope to implement)
